
hashCode() method has not been overridden in
Employee Class yet the a HashMap is being used to track duplicates. 

the problem is caused by the hashCode and equals contract in Java.
The contract is that if two objects are equal(by using equals() method), they must have the same hashCode().

The default implementation of public int hashCode() returns distinct integers for distinct objects.
In this particular situation, because we haven't defined our own hashCode() method, 
the default implementation will return two different integers for two compared Employee Objects.
